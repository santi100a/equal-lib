## Installation
- Via NPM: `npm install @santi100/equal-lib`
- Via Yarn: `yarn add @santi100/equal-lib`
- Via PNPM: `pnpm install @santi100/equal-lib`

## API

- `function arrayEquality<T>(array1: T[], array2: T[]): boolean;` Compares two arrays. It takes both arrays as arguments, and returns whether or not they are equal. 
- `function objectEquality<A extends Record<any, any>, B extends Record<any, any>>(obj1: A, obj2: B): boolean;` Compares two objects. It takes both objects as arguments, and returns whether or not they are equal.

Keep in mind that since version 1.0.2, this library can compare:
- Nested arrays or objects
- Arrays of objects
- Objects with arrays

**All previous versions are deprecated due to this.**
